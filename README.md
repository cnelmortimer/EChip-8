# EChip-8

## Description
Simple Chip-8 emulator written in Java by N.C. Cruz, UAL, 2016. 

EChip-8 features a standard and a fast execution mode, sizeable window and a virtual keyboard linked to the physical keyboard.

## What is CHip-8?
Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker in late 70's, as a virtual machine. It aimed to make videogame programming easier and more portable. Its CPU has only 35 CPU opcodes, and it is generally considered as the best project to learn about writing emulators. The interested reader is referred to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) for further information.

## Acknowledgements and ressources
This software was written to learn the basiscs of emulation. I did not know anything about emulation before and these ressources are very valuable to get started in software emulation (thank you all for sharing!):
